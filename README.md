LevenshteinDistance
===================

Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings

What is Levenshtein Distance?
In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for 
measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between 
two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) 
required to change one word into the other. It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this 
distance in 1965.
